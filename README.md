# Sales_Data
For the past three months I've been involved in intensive data analysis training on microsoft excel, Sql (Stuctured Query Langue) and Power BI. Each data analysis tool we were trained lasted for four weeks respectively. The facilitators were very relatable and were readily responsive to our questions. I especially enjoyed every class but most particularly the POWER BI sessions. As a requirement for advanced training, I have been tasked with a project known as the LITA CAPSTONE PROJECT to present all I've learnt thus far.

# Project Overview
In this project, a Sales data for a retail store is analyzed to find sales performance in determining key insights such as top performing products, regional performance and sales trends. Many tools were used to determine this. The project's goal is to make logical suggestions for how to maximize sales performance across all regions of the retail store.

# Data Sources
The primary source of data used here is LITA Capstone Dataset_27027859 and this is a source that was provided for by the Incubator Hub Data Analysis Instructors.

# Tools Used
